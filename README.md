Report will be written using Pandoc, each section segregated into its own file/folder.
 Just start getting the ideas flowing, it doesn't have to be perfect
 first time. Write, commit, push and review it together weekly.   

Requirements : Install Pandoc, Latex and Composer on your machine
(Composer not essential but highly recommended to automate builds)   

Uploaded to this repository will be:
 - All docs relating to deliverables on the report for reference/guidelines whilst writing
 - The report itself, segregated by chapter/section, easy to navigate to the section you wish to update   
 - All necessary configuration files to build the PDF i.e composer.json configs

 For all other queries regarding inserting images, table of contents, bibliographies, references and other configuration and setup stuff
