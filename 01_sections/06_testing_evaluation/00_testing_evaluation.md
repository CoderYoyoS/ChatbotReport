# Testing and Evaluation
The following section will discuss and highlight the testing and evaluation of the chatbot system. In addition, it will detail the tools and testing methods used to examine the functional correctness and usability of the chatbot. The testing phase was carried out to determine and ensure that the chatbot functioned in the appropriate manner and met the functional requirements as aforementioned. The tests were implement based on two types of testing methods which are API and Usability testing. The API category of testing encompasses testing an application program interface to examine its performance and dependability. The means in which these tests were carried was through the API testing tool Postman, which provides the means for sending HTTP requests and reading HTTP responses. Moreover the Usability testing method encompasses allowing a select group of users to interact with the application.
