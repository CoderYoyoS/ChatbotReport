# Testing and Evaluation
Testing and evaluation is a crucial and important part of any piece software to identify any bugs, errors or inconsistencies. This section will discuss and highlight the testing and evaluation of the chatbot system. In addition, it will detail the tools and testing methods used to examine the functional correctness and usability of the chat bot. The testing phase was carried out to determine and ensure that the chatbot functioned in the appropriate manner and met the functional requirements as aforementioned. The tests were implement based on two types of testing methods which are API and Usability testing. The API category of testing encompasses testing an application program interface to examine its performance and dependability. The means in which these tests were carried was through the API testing tool Postman, which provides the capability for sending HTTP requests and reading HTTP responses. In addition, the Usability testing technique comprises of a non-functional testing method in which it processes how easy the application can be interacted with the end users (tutorialspoint, 2017).  This was done by adding a select group of testers to the Facebook messenger platform in which the chatbot was made accessible to them.

###API Testing
API testing was incorporated to establish if each RESTful API implemented into the chatbots framework returned accurate responses based on each HTTP request sent. To accomplish this task a testing environment was setup. Which encompassed a setting in which tests can be carried out and a system whereby to document each test.  As aforementioned the API tests were carried out using Postman which is an API testing tool. Postman provides an environment in which to interact with APIâ€™s to construct HTTP requests and read HTTP responses. The tests constructed within Postman were designed to examine endpoints in each RESTful API with the required set of parameters using the HTTP GET function as each RESTful API only returns data. In order to successfully document all the tests carried out on each API endpoint tables were constructed to contain all test conditions and results for each API. In addition, to test in the Postman environment there are a number of parameters that must be provided, these include a URL, URI and a HTTP method. The below screen shot is an example of a test performed in Postman.

###Usability Testing
Usability testing was implemented to examine the manner in which the end user interacts with the chatbot.  Additionally, this form of testing was incorporated to determine and quantify the chatbots ease of use and the overall experience of the user while interacting with the application. As above mentioned this task was achieved by adding a select number of users as testers to the platform were the chatbot is housed. In addition, the users were observed interacting with the chatbot in an informal setting, thus making them more at ease and comfortable to suggest change. Changes were made to the chatbot in terms of conversational flow. A more button driven approach was taken due to the response of the testers. See appendix ? for screenshots of user interactions.
