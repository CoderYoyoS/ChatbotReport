# Testing and Evaluation
The following section will discuss and highlight the testing and evaluation of the chatbot system. In addition, it will detail the tools and testing methods used to examine the functional correctness and usability of the chatbot. The testing phase was carried out to determine and ensure that the chatbot functioned in the appropriate manner and met the functional requirements as aforementioned. The tests were implement based on two types of testing methods which are API and Usability testing. The API category of testing encompasses testing an application program interface to examine its performance and dependability. The means in which these tests were carried was through the API testing tool Postman, which provides the means for sending HTTP requests and reading HTTP responses. Moreover the Usability testing technique comprises of a non-functional testing method in which it processes how easy the application can be interacted with the end users (tutorialspoint, 2017).  This was done by adding fellow students as testers on the Facebook messenger platform in which the chatbot was made accessible and observed using the chatbot. .

##API Testing
The API tests were constructed in a manner to test the endpoints in each API.  The following table will detail each test scenario and there expected result. please see the table below
