# Testing and Evaluation
Testing and evaluation is a crucial and important part of any piece software to identify any bugs, errors or inconsistencies. This section will discuss and highlight the testing and evaluation of the chatbot system. In addition, it will detail the tools and testing methods used to examine the functional correctness and usability of the chat bot. The testing phase was carried out to determine and ensure that the chatbot functioned in the appropriate manner and met the functional requirements as aforementioned. The tests were implement based on two types of testing methods which are API and Usability testing. The API category of testing encompasses testing an application program interface to examine its performance and dependability. The means in which these tests were carried was through the API testing tool Postman, which provides the capability for sending HTTP requests and reading HTTP responses. In addition, the Usability testing technique comprises of a non-functional testing method in which it processes how easy the application can be interacted with the end users (tutorialspoint, 2017).  This was done by adding a select group of testers to the Facebook messenger platform in which the chatbot was made accessible to them.

###API Testing
API testing was incorporated to establish if each RESTful API implemented into the chatbots framework returned accurate responses based on each HTTP request sent. To accomplish this task a testing environment was setup. Which encompassed a setting in which tests can be carried out and a system whereby to document each test.  As aforementioned the API tests were carried out using Postman which is an API testing tool. Postman provides an environment in which to interact with HTTP APIâ€™s to construct requests and read responses. The tests constructed within Postman were designed to examine endpoints in each RESTful API with the required set of parameters using the HTTP GET function as each RESTful API only returns data. Moreover, to successfully conduct a test in Postman there are a number of conditions
