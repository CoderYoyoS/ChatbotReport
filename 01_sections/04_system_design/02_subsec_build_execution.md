##Build Execution
This section will demonstrate how the code progresses from the developers machine to running live on the Heroku app servers. This process is an integral factor to understand in order to visualise the pipeline of development and also to see an overview of how the code migrates from machine to app-server. There are {number} steps in order to fulfill this journey-to-deployment and they are:

1. Develop code locally
2. Test locally
3. Push to github repository
4. Ensure Heroku has auto-deployed
5. Test deployed implementation
