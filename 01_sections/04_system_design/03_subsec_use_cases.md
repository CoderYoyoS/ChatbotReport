##Conversational Flow Use Cases
This section aims to give an adequate understanding of the conversational design within the application. Depending on the context of the conversation that the user has engaged with, there are three pathways that the conversation can flow. These three different pathways are representative of the individual REST API's that each team member developed and outline the primary conversation flow that a user can be brought down. See figure {whatever} to see a logical representation of this.
