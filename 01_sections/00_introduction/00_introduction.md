# Introduction

This report aims to demonstrate and explain the core concepts of chat bot applications and their use in the field today. It shall be explained what a chat bot can and should do, the sophisticated fundamentals that consolidate a chat bot, their impactful influences and potential in the future. The delineation of good chat bot design and development shall also be touch upon, in conjunction with a given implementation using a range of technologies and services. Furthermore, this report will also be divided into apportions to present information considered and utilised in the duration the project. 
Initially, a literature review of the field of chat bots shall be analysed and evaluated to best explain the foundations of the chat bot era. A methodology section is given to justify the approach taken for this project. The system requirements and specifications section will highlight the tools and technologies utilised. A section on the design and form of the chat bot application is also given in order to describe the architecture chosen for this project. The implementation segment will describe in great details the building and construction of the application with aid of code snippets and explanations and diagrams. This will be followed by a section consisting of applications testing, and determining evaluations based on the results of the tests. Lastly, the report is concluded and furtherwork considerations are given.
