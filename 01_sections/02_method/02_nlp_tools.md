##NLP Tools

An important aspect of a chat bot application is its ability to comprehend what the user’s messages intents and contexts are when the user and the chatbot are conversing. This is achieved in chat bot technologies through the use of NLP. NLP employs computational techniques for the purpose of learning, understanding, and producing human language content through spoken language and text (site, NLP-site). This type of technology provides the capability of understanding the user’s intent which drives the actions of the chatbot. As aforementioned, NLP is an integral component of a chatbot, and in light of this, there has been many developments in the accessibility to NLP tools and platforms. There are now a number of services that provide NLP as a service, platforms such as Api.ai, Google Natural Language API and Wit.ai. With the creation of the above-mentioned services, bot developers can now easily implement NLP into chatbot architectures. However, there are a number of considerations in the deliberation of selecting one of these services. These may include the price, limitations and quality of the service.
