##Database

A database is also a significant element in the development and creation of a chat bot. There are a number of considerations to be reflected in terms of what type of database to be incorporated within the chat bot architecture. These can include a SQL database or a no SQL database. The difference between these types of architectures are SQL databases are table based while NoSQL databases are document based. This means that SQL databases embody data in form of tables which encompasses rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of documents or wide-column stores (Thegeekstuff, 2017). Both of these databases infrastructures can be incorporated into a chat bot. However, in the deliberation of selecting the appropriate database model, there are a number of considerations to be contemplated. For instance what type of data model does each hosting platform support, the scalability, complexity and cost of each architecture.
