##Programming language
A fundamental aspect to consider before developing a chat bot is the programming language it will be implemented in. The choice will be contingent on a number of factors. This includes the messaging platform (Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp etc.) in which the chatbot is hosted as each of the aforementioned platforms have their own technology compatibility guidelines for implementing this type of technology. However, chatbots housed on messenger platforms like Facebook Messenger and Telegram can be developed in any language due these platforms being language agnostic in comparison to another platform like Slack, in which chatbots must be developed in Python. In addition, the knowledge and preference of the developer in a particular language and the accessibility of the libraries suitable to the chatbotâ€™s design must be considered. In addition, server side languages such as PHP, Python and Node.JS (JavaScript) are typically used to write chatbots as they are popular server-side web programming technologies.
