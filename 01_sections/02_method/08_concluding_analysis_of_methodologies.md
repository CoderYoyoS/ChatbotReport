##Concluding Analysis of Methodologies

After the investigation of the current methods and techniques used to implement a chatbot application, a number of essential technologies have emerged as essential/highly beneficial to the development process.

(@) A messaging platform such as Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp etc. must be chosen before the project development commences. This is so the development team can adequately investigate what technologies(programming language, data formats etc.) will need to be explored in order for successful compliance and integration with the messaging platform.

(@) An NLP tool such as Api.ai or Wit.ai is a necessary decision to be made prior to development. This factor is imperative to training the chatbot with how to handle certain inputs in a novice-developer-friendly way whereby the chatbot can be trained in a simplistic manner and nullifying the need for the development team to have to implement their own NLP back-end system.

(@) A PaaS platform for deploying the application is an easy-deployment solution for getting the app hosted and running and available for users. There are many providers that are available and choosing the right one for the project centres around the compatible technologies that the platform supports.

(@) Deciding the appropriate server-side programming language and data model for the application are considerations that need to be made in-line with the PaaS provider compatible run-time environments and the messaging platform compatibly requirements.

(@) RESTful API development, for decentralising features of the application can also be considered as a formidable development decision for decoupling features and nullifying a single-point-of-failure within the application.
