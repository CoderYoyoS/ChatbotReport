There are a superabundance of chat bot platforms accessible on the web. And now big companies such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram and WeChat have allowed developers to integrate chat bots into their messenger platforms. Thus making accessibility to millions of user effortless. And providing considerable amounts of documentation to detail what their platforms are capable of providing.
