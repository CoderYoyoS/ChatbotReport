##Deployment Options

A deployment service is another aspect to be consider in the creation of this type of software. In selecting such a service there are a number of considerations that need to be considered which entail cost, CPU, RAM scalability and complexity. However, there are a number of deployment services that offer a Platform as a service (PaaS) with sufficient CPU specification which is easy to use and free of cost. Deployment facilities such as Microsoft Azure Bot Service, Google App Engine, Heroku and Docker provide this type of service. PaaS is a cloud based technology that delivers a platform as well as hardware, software and tools to allow developers to easily deploy and run chat applications over the internet (Interoute, 2017). Bot developers can take advantage and use the PaaS environments from conception, development and creation of their chat bot applications.
