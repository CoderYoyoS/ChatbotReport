##Version Control

Version control software is not a key element nor an integral part in the creation of chatbots however, they are in the development of software amongst a team. A version control system is a type of software or tool to track new files or all modifications made to a code base or project and be shared via a centralised server. There are a great number of version control systems such as Git, Bazaar and Mercurial. Furthermore, this type of technology enables the hastening and simplification of the software be developed (Otte, 2016). In addition, there are many benefits to be gain using this type of software. If any errors occur during the development process, version control systems provide the capability of rolling back to a stable version of the software to facilitate debugging and error checking. Moreover, this type of tool enables there to be many backups of the software on developerâ€™s local machines and in the cloud.
