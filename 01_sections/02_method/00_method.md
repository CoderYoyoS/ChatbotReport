# Method
The purpose of the subsequent section is to provide a detailed understanding and comprehension of the technologies used in the development of chat bots. This will encompass a high level description and illustration of the many different technologies used to successfully implement this type of the software. Furthermore, it will also highlight the core services, architectures and programming languages used in the development and creation of chat bots. In addition, all the other aspects such as feature selection (what the chat bot will be able to talk about) and how the conversation flow aspect of this technology is achieved within a chat bot (ruled based or AI).  For clarity and to gain a better appreciation of all the aforementioned aspects that goes into the development of chat bots each core feature (technology) will be broken up into its own section. These sections will include the platform that the bot is housed in, the platform as a service (PaaS), version where the application will be run, version control and all other above mentioned services.

##Messing Platform
One of the major and core consideration in the development of a chat bot application is the platform that the bot will go live on. There are a superabundance of chat bot platforms accessible on the web. And now big companies such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram and WeChat have allowed developers to integrate chat bots into their messenger platforms. Thus making accessibility to millions of user effortless. And providing considerable amounts of documentation to detail what their platforms are capable of providing you bot.  However, each platform has its own user base, interface, and capacities. And therefore selecting the appropriate platform depends on the type of chat bot is being developed and the targeted demographic.

##Deployment Options
A Deployment service is another key aspect in the creation of this type of software. In selecting such a service there are a number of considerations that need to be considered which entail cost, CPU, RAM scalability and complexity. However, there are a number of deployment services that offer a Platform as a service (PaaS) with sufficient CPU specification which is easy to use and cost free. Deployment facilities such as Microsoft Azure Bot Service, Google App Engine, Heroku and Docker provide this type of service. PaaS is a cloud based technology that delivers a platform as well as hardware, software and tools to allow developers to easily deploy and run chat applications over the internet (Interoute, 2017). Bot developers can take advantage and use the PaaS environments from conception, development and creation of their chat bot applications.

##Programming language
Another key area to consider in the creation of a chat bot is the language it's composed in. On the selection of a programming language for a chat bot there are numerous options. However, the choice will depend on a number of factors which include what message platform (Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram etc.) in which the bot is hosted. The experience and preference of the developer and the accessibility of the libraries appropriate to the bot’s creation. However, bots housed in Facebook Messenger, Telegram and WeChat can be developed in any language due to their infrastructure which provide API’s and webhooks. In addition, programming languages such as PHP, Python and NodeJs (JavaScript) are typically used to write chat bots. Furthermore, these server-side languages are employed due to the aforementioned Messing platforms handling the UI side of the application.

##Database
A database is also a significant element in the development and creation of a chat bot. There are a number of considerations to be reflected in terms of what type of database to be incorporated within the chat bot architecture. These can include a SQL database or a no SQL database. The difference between these types of architectures are SQL databases are table based while NoSQL databases are document based. This means that SQL databases embody data in form of tables which encompasses rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of documents or wide-column stores (Thegeekstuff, 2017 – site 4). Both of these databases can be incorporated into a chat bots, however a NoSQL structure is the better option for its simple and extensible document format (site 5) Moreover,
