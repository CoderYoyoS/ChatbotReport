The purpose of the subsequent section is to provide a detailed understanding and comprehension of the technologies and tools commonly used whilst developing a chatbot. This will encompass a high-level description and illustration of the many different technologies used to successfully implement this type of the software. Furthermore, it will also highlight the core services, architectures and programming languages used in the development and creation of chatbots. In addition,exploration of how the conversation flow aspect of this technology is achieved with NLP will be investigated. Additionally, there are some considerations for different technologies that will be highlighted in this selection. For clarity and to gain a better appreciation of all the aforementioned aspects that goes into the development of chat bots, each core feature (technology) will be broken up into its own section. These sections will include the platform that the bot is hosted on, the platform as a service (PaaS), version control platform where the application will be developed, and other useful tools that will aid the participating team members.
