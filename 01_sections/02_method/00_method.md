A chat bot is a conversational computer application, driven by a set of rules and sometimes artificial intelligence (AI) that a user interacts with via a chat interface. This service can facilitate any number of thing, stretching from practical to fun (Chatbot Magazine, 2017). In addition, Facebook, WeChat and others alike have opened up API’s to create these applications to be housed and work within their messaging applications.  This offers developers a change to avoid the overwhelmed app store and reach any number of clients (ChatBot Weekly, 2017). To develop this type of service there are a number of technologies, services and development tools required to successfully do so. The following section will outline and detail the many different technologies, architectures and programming languages used in creating Chat Bots. Furthermore, it will also look at other aspects such as feature selection (what the application will be able to talk about) and how conversation flow is achieved within a chat bot (ruled based or AI).

One major and core aspect in the development of a chat bot application is deployment technologies. On selecting a deployment platform for a chat bot there are a number of considerations to keep in mind such as scalability, complexity and cost. However, there are a number deployment solutions for bots that offers Platform as a service (PaaS). Some of these include Microsoft Azure Bot Services, Google App Engine, Heroku and Docker. PaaS is a cloud based technology that delivers a platform as well as hardware, software and tools to allow developers to easily deploy and run Chat applications over the internet (Interoute, 2017). Bot developers can take advantage and use the PaaS environments from conception to the development of their bot applications.

Another key area to consider in the creation of a chat bot is the language it's composed in. On the selection of a programming language for a chat bot there are numerous options. However, the choice will depend on a number of factors which include what message platform (Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram etc.) the bot is housed. The experience and preference of the developer and the accessibility of the libraries appropriate to the bot’s creation. However, bots housed in Facebook Messenger, Telegram and WeChat can be developed in any language due to their infrastructure which provide API’s and webhooks. In addition, programming languages such as PHP, Python and NodeJs (JavaScript) are typically used to write chat bots. Furthermore, these server-side languages are employed due to the aforementioned Messing platforms handling the UI side of the application.

A database is also a significant element in the development and creation of a chat bot. There are a number of considerations to be reflected in terms of what type of database to be incorporated within the chat bot architecture. These can include a SQL database or a no SQL database. The difference between these types of architectures are SQL databases are table based while NoSQL databases are document based. This means that SQL databases embody data in form of tables which encompasses rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of documents or wide-column stores (Thegeekstuff, 2017 – site 4). However, in the implementation of a database into a chat bot architecture a NoSQL is better because ??
