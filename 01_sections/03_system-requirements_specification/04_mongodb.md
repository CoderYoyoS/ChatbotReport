### MongDB

MongoDB is a non relational database that uses document-oriented storage. MongoDB Documents objects are files that stores JSON-like binary files thats are often reffered to as "BSON". MongoDB Collections are similar to tables in a relational databse management system. Collections consist of groups of Documents to store data. There are a few reason why using a non relational (NoSql) database proves  to be advantageous for the project at hand. Relational databases can only store structured data within tables. Should an application store various pieces of information that are not specificly the same for every instance, NoSql is ideal for this. The option for scalability should be something to possess if new or unexpected pieces of information need to be added to the database (Wodehouse,  2017).
