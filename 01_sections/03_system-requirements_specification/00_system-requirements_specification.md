# System Requirements and Specification

A wide range of tools and technologies have been considered and evaluated during the planning process of the proposed project. Each having similarities and differences, strengths and disadvantages and  fundamental necessities for a project of this scale.

Heroku is an online Platform as a service (PaaS). A PaaS can be defined as a services that allows for developers to deploy applications to the cloud without needed to take into consideration of hardware or software. Heroku supports a wide range of programming languages to be deployed on to it's service, including JavaScript, Ruby, PHP and python.
