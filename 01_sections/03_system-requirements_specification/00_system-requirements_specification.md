# System Requirements and Specification

## Functional Requirements

The proposed chat bot application's main desirable functionality is to provide students with a number of informational conversations about the college in real time. This involves the implementation of an easy-to-use system that shall engage with the user and provide an intuitive flow of conversation. The chat bot shall also be given with the ability to participate in basic conversational pieces to provide a more "human-like" interaction for the user.

1                                  Instant responses

                                    ease of use
-------------------------------------------------------------

(@)  The chat bot application shall consist of the ability to response to a user almost instantaneously when a conversation is invoked. A user may begin a conversation with the application by using the ``` Get started ``` button or by simply messaging the chat bot. In turn, the chat bot shall respond instantly to provide the user with a quick and efficient means of obtaining information.
(@)  Conversation capabilities shall be incorporated in order to provide a "human-like" experience for the user. The chat bot shall respond using informal and natural phrases and expressions. An example of this use case would be a user saying "hello" to the chat bot. This should result in a natural reply in terms of language and structure. Additionally, the chat bot shall have multiple responses for the same input. To give a more of an organic interaction, the chatbot shall be able to respond in a number of ways for the same kind of message it has received. For instance, if a user asks "whats up?", the chatbot should be able to react with several meaningful responses.
(@) The application shall be able to handle the input of natural language by humans. The use of natural language process provides a means to extract meaning full data and contexts from human input and operate with large conversations. Additionally, it shall be able to understand the input from a human given the event of a human incorrectly spelling a word using the method of lexical analysis and evaluating the conversational discourse. A use case of this would be if a user typed "I am on the __bua__" instead of saying the word "bus", the chatbot shall still be able to understand the intent of the conversation.
(@) Lastly, the chat bot establish an easy and intuitive conversational flow to guide the user through the dialogue to provide the most meaningful interaction as possible. This shall be achieved by providing the user with as much information as possible in order to prevent the user from being confused or disinterested with the interaction. This could be done through the use of buttons or menus.

## User Interface Specification
The system shall be comprised with an intuitive and clean design. Chat bot applications should give a means for the user to instantly interact without an unsolicited need to type every response they wish to give. To accommodate for this, the use of buttons should be implemented to allow for a user to interact quickly and efficients. In the case of graphical user interface design, no GUI implementation is possible as the interface is provided by Facebook's Messenger application. However, Facebook does provide a number of templates, menus and buttons that can be utilised to design a smooth and straightfoward in interaction with the application. These content types use raw JSON which is sent to the Messenger Send API to generate sleek and appealing graphical interface for a messenger chat conversation. The application should make use of a number of these content types in order to display the understanding and comprehension of using the assets that Facebook provides.
