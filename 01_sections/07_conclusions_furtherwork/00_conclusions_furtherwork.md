## Conclusion



## Further work
Although the development of the chatbot application was successful, there is a few considerable approaches to appraise should the opportunity arise again to recreate the project. One notable consideration is the utilisation of the a continuous integration tool like Travis CI. Travis CI allows team members team members integrate code to a repository and run automated builds. This would prove advantageous as it tests the changes that are being made and prevents defective code to be deployed to the application. Another considerable approach to the development of the chatbot is to implement a more comprehensive natural language processing agent. As there are minor conversational pieces that can be obtained from the chatbot, the conversations are mostly button driven. It would be desired to give a balance between button driven and text driven conversations. Furthermore, the ability to provide other campus information like real time class room or parking space availability would be highly sought after.
