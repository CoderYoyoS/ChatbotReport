The proceeding literature review will highlight several areas of notoriety regarding chat bots Relevant journal articles and web articles will be chosen to review in order to establish a core understanding of the current state of the advancements in NLP, AI and the new opportunities for developers in light of these advancements. Whilst there are considerable resources available to research the history of NLP, machine learning and AI, there is a scarcity of academic resources centred around chat bots because of their recent emergence to the app market. In light of this, web articles from credible websites will be used to formulate an opinion on their current position in the eyes of developers and their projected success. In order to provide a foundation of understanding to the reader initially, the specifics of what a chat bot is and it’s origins will be explored. Additionally, current developments in the field of AI, virtual-assistants and current applications of chat bots will also be analysed and supported by current literature. Finally, an analysis of the literature reviewed will be delivered in a thematic way, whereby insights will be provided as to why chat bots present an interesting learning opportunity for this project, why implementing a chat bot is achievable within the projects scope of difficulty and also, the core learning deliverables that reveal themselves from analysing the literature reviewed.
