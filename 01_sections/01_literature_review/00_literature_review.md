# Literature Review

The proceeding literature review will highlight several areas of interest regarding ChatBots, *what* they are, what functionality they provide to an end-user and other interesting traits that this particular type of application possesses. Furthermore, an analysis of the software engineering processes and practices that are adopted in order to implement a ChatBot application will be analyzed and justified. The following sections will be constructed in a thematic way, with each section covering its own individual theme centered around ChatBots and the industry-proven software engineering practices that bring them to fruition. A study of past work in this area will be analysed and finally, an evaluation of how this work lends itself to this study will be explored.
