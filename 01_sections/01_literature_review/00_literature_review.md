# Literature Review

The proceeding literature review will highlight several areas of notoriety regarding chatbots. Relevant journal articles and web articles will be chosen to review in order to establish a core understanding of the current state of the advancements in natural language processing(NLP), machine learning, artificial intelligence(AI) and the new opportunities for developers in light of these advancements. Whilst there are an abundance of resources available to research the history of NLP, machine learning and AI, there is a scarcity of academic resources centred around chat bots because of their recent emergence to the app market. In light of this, web articles from credible websites will be used to formulate an opinion on their current position in the eyes of developers and their projected success. In order to provide a foundation of understanding to the reader initially, the specifics of what a chat bot is and its origins will be explored. Additionally, current developments in the field of AI, virtual-assistants and current applications of chat bots will also be analysed and supported by current literature. Finally, an analysis of the literature reviewed will be delivered in a thematic way, whereby insights will be provided as to what the relevance of chatbot technologies are today, the increase in accessibility to tools for developers and the opportunities that reveal themselves for this project.
