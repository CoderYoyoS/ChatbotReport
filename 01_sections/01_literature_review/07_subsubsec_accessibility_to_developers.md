With the advent of NLP platforms being open to developers to use their API’s it is now possible for novice developers to harness the computational power of proven NLP algorithms and build their own intelligent agents. Furthermore, developers can implement NLP features into their applications without having to have an in-depth knowledge of the lower-levels of developing software that can handle complex linguistic queries. These NLP API’s, because of the surge in chat bot popularity, are mostly free to use and provide an ideal alternative to developers who do not want to ‘re-invent the wheel’. This shift has provided a broad spectrum of opportunity to developers who may have once been prohibited from implementing applications because of a lack of resources/knowledge in this area.
