##Current Developments in Industry

Whilst these technologies are accessible to end-users through their client devices, accessibility for developers to build applications with these powerful NLP capabilities has only recently being made available. Until recently, if a developer sought these powerful NLP capabilities for their own application they would have to implement the NLP algorithms and also build the applications front-end to interact with their custom language API. This is a lengthy and difficult task for developers that do not have access to Apple’s, Microsoft’s, Amazon’s or Google’s proprietary AI software API’s(Evans, 2017). Now with the emergence of software development frameworks that provide open-API’s for programmers to access powerful NLP engines for their applications, a developer can develop and produce their own implementation of an intelligent agent. Furthermore, popular messaging platforms have also provided SDK’s for developers to build Chatbots and release them on their platform. These two defining changes within the industry has seen a rapid advancement in the field of ChatBot development and subsequently created significant opportunity in the realms of e-commerce and added a new layer to mobile application capabilities(Dale, 2016).
