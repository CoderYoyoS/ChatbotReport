###Relevance of Chatbot Technologies

Judging from the articles that have been reviewed, there is clear cause for interest in this emerging technology. Although this technology is not new in regard to research and its origins reach back as far as 1966, there has been a notable surge in interest as of late owing namely to the growth of NLP development frameworks and tools. A sub-reason to this explosive new-found relevance can also be attributed to the large messaging platforms providing SDK's for developers. Although it is hard to gauge whether chatbots will take over traditional applications in this space, little argument can be made against the up-surge in publications on them and their backing received from the big messaging platforms. Based on common consensus between articles reviewed for this paper, ultimately, time and user adoption will dictate chatbot's validity in the app marketplace of tomorrow. However, in light of doing research, they present themselves with ample opportunity to explore the world of NLP and AI from a novice developer's perspective.
