##What Is a Chat Bot?

Chatbots are computer programs that mimic conversation with people using artificial intelligence (Wong, 2016). It is a service powered by rules and sometimes artificial intelligence ("Chatbots Magazine", 2016). Usually, the common use case for end-users using a text-based conversational interface would be when they are messaging each other on popular client devices like their phone or laptop. Now users can have similar conversations with a piece of software that can intelligently respond to them in a human-like manner. This type of technology can be driven by basic parsing of an input to analyse for keywords and output a message, or the chat bot can be implemented in such a way whereby the input is parsed using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine that can extract message components like context, ambiguity and sentiment. The NLP engine can then statistically analyse the input and provide an output to the end-user based on the result it deems most accurate. Chatbots can also *learn* by implementing automated machine learning algorithms. A chat bot can perform peculiarly when queried by a high volume of inputs, and these inputs are difficult for developers to preempt during development. In the situation, whereby the chat bot does not understand an input, intelligent algorithms can be used to analyse the misunderstood input and suggest the most likely output based on the data gathered from parsing the initial input. There are several ways that these types of technology can come to fruition, however, the core use case is always similar. Based on the input provided from the user, the chat bot should always intelligently deliver an appropriate output.
