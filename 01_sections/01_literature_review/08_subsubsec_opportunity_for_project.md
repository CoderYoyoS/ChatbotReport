###Opportunities for the Project

This newly introduced accessibility to NLP engines and popular messaging platforms provides ample reason to explore these platforms during this project for the purposes of gauging their accessibility and performance. Moreover, these API’s will, most importantly, provide the team members with an opportunity to develop the ChatBot in-line with the API’s specifications, providing the participants with experience of querying web services to further enhance the applications capabilities. Also, the participants will gain experience with deciding which platform to deploy the ChatBot application to. Knowledge will be gained in regards to deciding which platforms that best-support the  technologies and programming languages that the team members are familiar with. Above all else, experimentation with new types of software, especially AI driven implementations, can provide the participants with a fresh perspective on software development in general and elevate their understanding of designing a distributed application that interacts with several nodes to fulfill its intended functionality.
